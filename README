Safarium
========

Safarium is a simple Chrome extension for adding some of Safari's behaviors to
the page. Here's a summary of the features it adds:

<TAB>
  Instead of cycling through all links and form elements on the page, tab will
  cycle only through form elements. Includes <SHIFT-TAB>. Use <OPTION-TAB> to
  use Chrome's built in <TAB> behavior.

<COMMAND-ENTER>
  Submits a form into a new background tab. When that cannot be done, for whatever
  reason, it will fall back to the default form submission behavior.
